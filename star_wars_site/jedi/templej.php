                        <h2>Jedi Temple</h2>
                        <img src="../images/temple/jeditemple.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>The Jedi Temple (also known as the Palace of the Jedi) was the headquarters of the Jedi Order from the conclusion of the Great Sith War to the Great Jedi Purge and during that time was home to its major training, bureaucratic and dormitory facilities. Jointly operated by the Order and the Galactic Republic, the Temple was sealed to all but the Jedi and their allies, with very few public areas. The complex would be abandoned and largely destroyed at the time of the Declaration of a New Order when the Order was utterly routed by the Galactic Empire. Upon the rise of the Galactic Alliance, the Temple was rebuilt for the reformed Order under the leadership of Luke Skywalker.</p>
                        <p>The Coruscant Temple's origins date back to 5000 BBY when, at the beginning of the Great Hyperspace War, the Galactic Republic granted the Jedi land on Coruscant over the sacred spire, which contained a Force nexus. A holy place for the local Coruscanti, the Republic hoped by granting the Order land they would build a massive fortress like those they had established on Ossus, Falang Minor, and Haashimut. However, the Order did not wish to entangle themselves with the politics of the capitol or become a symbol of war and opted to build only a small meditative enclave. It wasn't until the Old Sith Wars saw the devastation of Ossus and the Great Jedi Library located there that the Order decided to re-establish its academy at the sacred spire. At the behest of the Order's wisest thinkers, the Four Masters began the painstaking task of building the Temple Ziggurat. Growing steadily for the next thousand years the Temple incorporated various pieces of historical works and architecture from their past, including tiles and stained-glass mosaics from the lost complex on Ossus.</p>
                        <p>Following nearly a thousand years of peace, the Order was threatened by a new darkness. The future became even more clouded than was usual, the High Council could not predict events or sense disturbances as it once could. It was during this time of uneasiness in the ranks of the Order that the Temple became prone to attack.</p>
                        <p>The Temple first came under siege in 44 BBY when a series of robberies plagued the Temple. The High Council ordered Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Tahl to uncover the thief and present him before the Council for judgment. Ranging from shredded tunics to missing training lightsabers, the threat became more serious when the Healing Crystals of Fire went missing. Even more extreme, while he wandered through the Room of a Thousand Fountains, an attempt was made on Grand Master Yoda's life. While Yoda came away unscathed, the entire Temple was stricken with fear as its walls were no longer a buffer against attack. When it was discovered that apprentice Bruck Chun was working in league with the mysterious intruder, the Dark Jedi Xanatos, Masters Jinn and Tahl began pondering on what Xanatos' true intentions were. Gathering information from Master Yoda the two investigating Jedi deduced the Dark Jedi was after the vertex stored in the Temple Treasury. Planning on setting a trap while Tech Specialist Miro Daroon began cycling the sabotage Temple power grid, Jinn and his Padawan managed to lure Xanatos and Chun to the top of the High Council Tower. While Jinn was able to protect the Temple and recover the Healing Crystals, Xanatos escaped to plague the Order for a time, while Chun was defeated by Obi-Wan Kenobi and accidentally killed, having fallen off a waterfall in the Room of a Thousand Fountains. The Temple was also referred to as the Palace of the Jedi.</p>
                        <p>Following the Declaration of a New Order and the rise of the Galactic Empire the Sith used the Temple as a trap. Broadcasting a false signal to surviving Jedi telling them to return to the Temple as the Clone Wars were over, the Empire planned to execute the survivors of Order 66 as they returned to their home. Fortunately for the remaining Jedi, Grand Master Yoda and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi had been rescued by Senator Bail Organa and decided to return to the Temple and deactivate the beacon. Entering through a sublevel hangar the Jedi slew Decoy Squad Five and made their way through the Temple until they reached the central security station where they were able to recalibrate the beacon to warn the survivors to run and hide. While there Kenobi delved into the security holos and confirmed his worst fear, the man behind the slaughter was Anakin Skywalker, his former student and friend. The two Jedi separated in order to hunt down the two Sith and kill them; neither succeeded but Vader was critically injured, setting back Sidious's expectations for him.</p>
                        <p>After the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Galactic Alliance's Chief of State Cal Omas ordered that a new Temple be erected for the Order. Using blueprints salvaged from the ruined Archives, the Reconstruction Authority built the new Temple almost exactly as it had stood several decades before. However the structure did not lack its differences. A new transparisteel and duracrete pyramid was built over the exterior, encasing the Council spires within it. Many on the reformed High Council feared the determination to preserve the past was a sign that the Jedi could not move forward and would once again be tools of the government, rather than a dignified tribute to their ancient Order.</p>
                        <p>After years of standing watch over Coruscant, the Temple was conquered in 130 ABY and was renamed the Temple of the Sith after Darth Krayt and his new Sith Order took control of the Galactic Empire. With the transparisteel pyramids stripped away Krayt redesigned the Temple so that its appearance caused fear and forced obedience. From the central stone pyramid smoke constantly billowed filling the Precinct with a dreary smog.</p>
