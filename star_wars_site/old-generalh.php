                        <h2>Old Galactic Republic</h2>
                        <img src="images/history/old.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>The Galactic Republic, also known as the Grand Republic or simply as the Republic, was a democratic union comprising thousands of star systems spread across the galaxy. Old Republic was a term affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, and the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power from 300 BBY to 82 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the Republic head of state, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.</p>
                        <p>The Republic governed the galaxy from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting various sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. After centuries of conflict, culminating in the fall of the Old Republic, the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years. The Republic's history was officially reset, and the ages before this event were merged into a collective whole known as the Old Republic-era.</p>
                        <p>The Republic entered a period of decline after centuries of expansion and prosperity. Aided by the resurgent Sith Lords, the Separatist Crisis divided the galaxy between the Republic Loyalists and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Grand Army of the Republic was organized under the leadership of Jedi Generals who led the Republic Military against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. However, the conlfict had been orchestrated to allow Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the alter ego of Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith—to control the Republic in a dictatorial manner. With the war's end and the extermination of the Jedi through Order 66, Sidious transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire by declaring himself Galactic Emperor. The Imperial Senate stood as the last remnant of the Old Republic until it was disbanded by the Emperor at the height of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was fully reorganized into the New Republic, restoring the democratic system of its predecessor after a generation of Imperial rule.</p>
                        <h3>Birth of freedom</h3>
                        <p>The original Galactic Republic was formed in approximately 25,000 BBY and rose to power by expanding across the galaxy, with several of its founding members being the planets Alderaan and Chandrila. Around 20,000 years prior to the Imperial Era, the Thisspiasian Blood Monarchy joined the Galactic Republic in its early founding. Multiple versions of the Republic existed throughout its extensive history; historians referred to this pre-modern period as the "Old Republic," although the government's official name was the Galactic Republic. The Old Republic's capital was located on the urban world of Coruscant, and would remain there for thousands of years.</p>
                        <p>At least six thousand years before the start of the Galactic Civil War, a rogue faction of Jedi broke away from the Jedi Order, believing that practicing the dark side of the Force would benefit in the furthering of Jedi power. This schism divided the Order on ideological grounds, igniting an event known as the Hundred-Year Darkness, which, in turn, resulted in the formation of the Sith. At one point, they managed to construct a dark shrine on Coruscant. The rogue faction was ultimately defeated and they were exiled from the Old Republic into uncharted space.</p>
                        <p>At some point, the Jedi Temple was constructed over the Sith shrine in order to contain its dark energy. Once it had established itself on Coruscant, the Jedi Order came to closely associate itself with the Old Republic, serving as guardians of the peace and justice for over a thousand generations. Little did the Jedi know, the Sith had regrouped on the planet Moraband.</p>
                        <p>Thousands of years before the Imperial Era, the Corellian royalty sponsored exploration and colonization efforts that helped expand the frontiers of the Old Republic.</p>
                        <h3>Fall of the Old Republic</h3>
                        <p>With the civilization of the Sith and the warrior culture of Mandalore, and with their beliefs of continual warfare without regard to the Jedi mandate of protecting the weak, the Jedi Order continued to mobilize its forces in an effort to stop enemy incursion into Old Republic space.</p>
                        <p>The power of the Sith Empire increased during the fall of the Old Republic. The Sith soon achieved near-dominance across the galaxy. Also during this time, an ancestor of Pre Vizsla of House Vizsla, leader of the Mandalorian group Death Watch during the Clone Wars, managed to steal the Darksaber from the Jedi Temple.</p>
                        <p>At some point the galaxy entered a state known as the Dark Age. During this time, the Jedi-Sith War broke out. Early on in this conflict, the Old Republic capital world of Coruscant was taken over by the Sith during the Battle of Coruscant. Later on in the war, the Sith were driven off the planet by the Jedi during the Liberation of Coruscant.</p>
