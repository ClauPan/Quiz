                        <p>The remnant of the Galactic Empire and Palpatine's Sith threatened the galaxy in the following decades in various resurgent forms, such as the Imperial Warlords who engaged in inter-imperial war even as they opposed the New Republic, a reunited Empire led by a possessed clone of Palpatine, the military campaigns of Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the machinations of Palpatine's former Sith Acolytes, such as the Emperor's Hands and other Dark Side Adepts or the Second Imperium. The New Republic, now called the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, almost returned to the practices of Palpatine's Empire during the Second Galactic Civil War with the Confederation under the guidance of Darth Caedus, the apprentice of Lumiya, the Dark Lady of the Sith. The Imperial Remnant would eventually unify with the Galactic Alliance, and Jagged Fel would become Emperor of the Empire, establishing the Fel Empire. The Fel Empire turned away from the teachings of the Sith, and actively opposed Darth Krayt's One Sith after the Sithâ€“Imperial War in 127 ABY.</p>
