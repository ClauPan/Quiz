                        <h2>Shrine in the Depths</h2>

                        <p>The Shrine in the Depths was an ancient Sith shrine constructed at a Force vergence on the planet Coruscant, constructed before the rise of the modern Galactic Republic. The Jedi Order later constructed the Jedi Temple over the shrine, hoping to neutralize its dark energies, and occasionally nullified dark side artifacts inside of it. However, the residual power of the dark side of the Force inherent in the shrine seeped out over the intervening millennia, weakening the precognitive abilities of the Order.</p>
                        <p>The Sith constructed a shrine on the planet Coruscant around five millennia before the rise of the Galactic Empire on top of a light side vergence, hoping to corrupt it with the dark side of the Force, which eventually succeeded. The enormous black edifice stood against the Coruscant sky as a symbol of Sith dominance until it was razed by the Jedi at the end of a great war. Following the Sith Order's defeat at the hands of their sworn enemies, the Jedi Order, the Jedi Temple was erected over the shrine's foundations in a symbolic attempt to bury the legacy that the Sith had left behind on the galactic capital. The Jedi also hoped that the placement of their Temple over the shrine, and the presence of so many light-side adepts within it, would serve to neutralize and cap the dark power inherent in the shrine, and eventually return the vergence to the light side. The shrine itself was something of an oddity, as such places were known to exist only on planets that had been historically considered to be Sith worlds.</p>
                        <p>Over the intervening millennia, the dark energies of the shrine seeped upward and outwards, weakening the Jedi Order. However, even the most powerful of Jedi Masters remained completely unaware of this fact, and believed that the shrine's power had been successfully contained. About a thousand years before the destruction of the Jedi Order at the hands of Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, the existence of the shrine became known to the Sith Lords of Darth Bane's revised Order, and remained a closely guarded secret. The Jedi normally kept the shrine covered by a meditation area, only opening the shrine to perform rituals aimed at neutralizing dark side artifacts. During the High Republic Era, a set of four statues found at an ancient Amaxine station was brought to the Shrine to be neutralized. However, those performing the ritual discovered that the statues contained nothing to neutralize, and realized that the Jedi who had brought the statues in had misinterpreted their true purpose.</p>
                        <p>Following the destruction of the Jedi Order, and the reformation of the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire, Darth Sidious—known publicly as Emperor Palpatine—had the Jedi Temple converted into the Imperial Palace. It was at that time that Sidious made the decision to excavate the shrine, the process of which was carried out entirely by machines under the supervision of Sidious' personal droid 11-4D. The shrine's existence remained as much a secret as it ever had; only Sidious himself was known for certain to possess knowledge of it. Even Darth Vader, Sidious' Sith apprentice and second in command, was unaware of the shrine's existence as of 14 BBY. Sidious used the shrine as his private sanctum and spent much of his time there meditating on the nature of the dark side. Eventually, he planned on enlisting Vader's help within the shrine to probe the dark side for its most powerful secrets, hoping to gain the ability to reshape reality according to his own ideals.</p>
