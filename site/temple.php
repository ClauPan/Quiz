                        <p>Jedi temples were structures built by the Jedi Order on many worlds across the galaxy. They were constructed on quiet locations that often harbored rare kyber crystals. Although the first of those temples was erected on the aquatic world of Ahch-To, the one built on Coruscant over the foundations of an ancient Sith shrine ended up becoming the main headquarters of the Order. In fact, many Jedi temples were built over conquered Sith temples in an effort to purify the site.</p>
                        <p>Other Jedi temples included:</p>
                        <p>The temple on Ilum.</p>
                        <p>The temple on Vrogas Vas.</p>
                        <p>The temple on Ossus.</p>
                        <p>A temple on Dantooine.</p>
                        <p>The temple on Lothal.</p>
                        <p>The Temple of Eedit on Devaron.</p>
                        <p>The temple on Ledeve.</p>
                        <p>The Temple of the Force on Ashas Ree.</p>

                   <p>Sith temples were pyramidal structures built by the Sith Order on many worlds across the galaxy. Dating back as far as the days of the Old Republic, numerous Sith temples were erected, including at least two located on the Sith homeworld of Moraband, the one on the ravaged planet of Malachor, and the one on the volcanic world of Mustafar. At some point before 10 BBY, the crime lord Dryden Vos plundered a Sith temple and obtained a slab of obsidian stone carved with hieroglyphs representing warding spells.</p>
