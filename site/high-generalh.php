                        <h2>High Galactic Republic</h2>

                        <p>The High Republic Era was a period of time that lasted for around two hundred years between approximately 300 BBY and 82 BBY in which the Galactic Republic was said to be at its height. It was also a golden age for the Jedi, who were significantly more active throughout the galaxy, and a time of expansion and exploration in the Outer Rim Territories.</p>
                        <p>According to the stories told among Jedi Initiates, Klias Teradine was a Padawan who lived during this era and also discovered the Bogan Collection. An event known as the Great Disaster, in which starships across the galaxy were suddenly kicked out of hyperspace, also occurred during this era.</p>
                        <p>During this time, the galaxy was not as settled as it was by the time of the Galactic Civil War, as areas like the Outer Rim were dangerous and difficult to navigate. In response, an enormous space station called the Starlight Beacon, one of Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh's Great Works, was constructed at a great effort and expense and placed in the center of the dark zones. The station would send out a signal that acted as a beacon, helping travelers find their way.</p>
                        <p>The Starros and San Tekka clans were known to be active during this period. Jedi Master Porter Engle, known as the Blade of Bardotta, also dated from this period. Avar Kriss was a pre-eminent Jedi Master from the period, who became known as the "Hero of Hetzal" for her efforts in leading a group of Jedi to rescue civilians during the Great Disaster. The marauder group known as the Nihil were soon discovered to be responsible for the tragedy.</p>
                        <p>Long after the High Republic Era, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and the galactic explorer Lor San Tekka traveled to a Jedi outpost on the Outer Rim planet Elphrona, located on the edge of the Unknown Regions. Given its distance from the Core, Tekka speculated that the outpost could have been built during the High Republic Era.</p>
