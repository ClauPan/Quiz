                        <h2>New Galactic Republic</h2>
                        <img src="images/history/new.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>The New Republic, also known simply as the Republic, was an interstellar republic and restoration of the Galactic Republic that replaced the Galactic Empire as the new galactic authority at the end of the Galactic Civil War. The Republic was composed of various member worlds spread across light-years of space. Instead of affixing the Galactic Senate to Coruscant, the galaxy's historical seat of government, the capital shifted from one Republic world to another on a rotating basis. Beginning with the Core World Chandrila, homeworld of Chancellor Mon Mothma, the new system culminated in Hosnian Prime, which served as the Republic's final capital approximately three decades into the New Republic Era.</p>
                        <p>With the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was reorganized into the New Republic, which was officially founded a year later. Modeled on the principles of its predecessor, the New Republic strove to dismantle Palpatine's New Order by restoring democracy after an era of Imperial rule. After the Battle of Jakku, the Republic accepted the Empire's formal surrender in 5 ABY, resulting in the Galactic Concordance peace treaty that ended the civil war in the same year. The New Republic Defense Force was significantly reduced, serving as a peacekeeping force while individual member worlds raised their own planetary defense forces. The Republic was only a fraction of the size of its predecessors, and therefore, relied on egalitarian policies to remain on friendly terms with neutral star systems.</p>
                        <p>A Cold War between the Republic and the First Order began following the Centrists' withdrawal from the galactic government. Senator Leia Organa created the Resistance as a result of the Senate's unwillingness to risk open conflict with the First Order. In 34 ABY, the Senate was destroyed along with Hosnian Prime by the First Order's superweapon, Starkiller Base. The Republic subsequently collapsed during the war that ensued, while large swathes of the galaxy were conquered by the First Order. However, Organa's Resistance persisted and was eventually able to defeat the First Order, giving rise to the hope of the Republic's rebirth.</p>
                        <h3>Early foundations</h3>
                        <p>For millennia, the galaxy had been governed by the Galactic Republic. Centered on the capital world of Coruscant, the Old Republic fell and was replaced by the modern Galactic Republic, which was ruled by the Galactic Senate, which in turn was led by an elected Supreme Chancellor. Under the protection of the Jedi Order, a religious order of Force wielders who possessed seemingly supernatural power through connection with the Cosmic and Living Force, the "second" incarnation of the Republic enjoyed a millennium of peace and prosperity. However, as time went on, the government of the Republic became bloated and corrupt. The Senate, filled with self-serving politicians, was unable to deal effectively with disputes that arose between the member worlds of the Republic. With growing protest from the outer systems over one-sided trade deals and centuries of economic exploitation, about ten years before the eruption of the Clone Wars, a dispute over plasma exports and the taxation of Free Trade Zones in the galaxy caused the Trade Federation to invade the planet Naboo. Although the Jedi, with the assistance of the Naboo people and the Gungans, were able to end the occupation, then senator of Naboo Sheev Palpatine took advantage of the conflict, which he had secretly organized, leading to his successful election as Supreme Chancellor. In secret, Palpatine was Darth Sidious, a Dark Lord of the Sith, whose order was thought to be extinct, and he sought to restore the Sith Empire. Palpatine then manipulated the rise of a Secessionist Movement, during which time worlds who had become disaffected with the Republic seceded to form the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The discovery of the Separatist Droid Army, as well as a clone army for the Republic commissioned secretly by Palpatine, by the Jedi eventually led to the First Battle of Geonosis and the first major war in a thousand years, the Clone Wars. For three years, the galaxy fell into chaos, and for three years, Chancellor Palpatine amassed more emergency powers to the Office of the Chancellor, and made changes to the Galactic Constitution.</p>
                        <p>As the Clone Wars drew to a close, a group of 2,000 concerned senators formed the Delegation of 2,000; they created the Petition of 2,000, which identified the entire membership of the group, formally protested Palpatine's actions, and demanded he return to the Senate the emergency powers he had claimed following the conclusion of the war. However, when the Jedi discovered Palpatine's identity as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and that he was not going to give back his power, a group of Jedi attempted to arrest Palpatine but failed following the intervention of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker on Palpatine's behalf. Skywalker joined with Sidious and became his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Palpatine issued Order 66, which forced the clone troopers to execute their Jedi Generals via pre-installed bio-chips, while Vader led the Siege of the Jedi Temple. Palpatine then called together the Senate in an emergency session of Congress, where he denounced the attempt to arrest him as a Jedi rebellion. He then declared that the Republic would be reorganized into the Galactic Empire and proclaimed himself Emperor.</p>
                        <h3>Origins</h3>
                        <p>Resistance groups emerged on a number of worlds as the Empire tightened its grip on the galaxy, which, in time, caused the Galactic Civil War to break out. However, under the leadership of Senators Mon Mothma and Bail Organa, rebel cells eventually coalesced into the full-blown Alliance to Restore the Republic. These resistance fighters resolved to depose the Emperor from his rule over the galaxy and restore the Republic. In 0 BBY, the Emperor disbanded the Imperial Senate, the last remnant of the Old Republic still within the Empire, as the Empire unveiled the planet-destroying Death Star. However, the Rebel Alliance destroyed the battle station at the Battle of Yavin. Despite an ensuing four years of setbacks, in 4 ABY, the Rebel Alliance fought the Empire again at the decisive Battle of Endor. During the battle, Darth Vader sacrificed himself in order to save his son, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, by killing the Emperor, while the Rebel Alliance successfully destroyed a second Death Star. Retreating to the Annaj system, the Empire had suffered a crippling defeat as it began to crumble.</p>
