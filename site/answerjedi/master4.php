                        <h2>Plo Koon</h2>
                        <img src="../images/jedi-master/plokoon.png" alt="">
                        <p>Plo Koon was a Kel Dor Jedi Master who served as a member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. He served as a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war he frequently undertook dangerous missions with the soldiers under his command, the 104th Battalion.</p>
                        <p>Koon was a survivor of the First Battle of Geonosis, the opening salvo of the Clone Wars that claimed the lives of nearly 200 Jedi. Early in the war he embarked on a mission to track down the Separatist warship Malevolence. Following several attempts to destroy the weapon, Koon and several of his peers managed to take it down. Among the Jedi he often worked with was Ahsoka Tano, whom he had discovered years before the war and shared a special bond with. During the war he played vital roles in the First and Second battles of Felucia, the Battle of Lola Sayu, and the Battle of Kadavo. As the conflict thickened, Ahsoka was framed for a terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple and was subsequently removed from the Jedi Order. When the true culprit was discovered, Koon and the Council offered her a chance to rejoin, but she refused and left the Jedi.</p>
                        <p>In the late stages of the Clone Wars, Koon led the 442nd Siege Battalion in the Battle of Cato Neimoidia. As he and a squadron of ARC-170 starfighters flew over the bridge cities following their victory, he was shot down and executed by his troops during the issuance of Order 66, during which the Jedi were massacred across the galaxy by their soldiers.</p>
                        <h3>Biography</h3>
                        <h4>Early life</h4>
                        <p>Plo Koon was born on the planet Dorin. Koon eventually became a Jedi Master of the Jedi Order.</p>
                        <p>After Warlord Guattako kidnapped several Padawans and took them to the planet Oosalon. Jedi Master Mace Windu was sent to find and rescue them. Eventually Windu was able to defeat all of Guattako's army. When it was just Windu and Guattako, Guattako knocked out Windu. But before Guattako could kill Windu, he was shot by a young Jedi. Shortly after Koon, Depa Billaba, and Qui-Gon Jinn arrived to help.</p>
                        <p>While on a mission to the planet Shili, the homeworld of the Togruta, Koon found a three-year old girl named Ahsoka Tano, who was sensitive to the Force. Koon brought Tano back to the Jedi Temple so she could be trained as a Jedi. The two kept in touch over the years, maintaining a close bond and friendship.</p>
                        <p>By the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Koon had achieved the rank of Jedi Master and was elevated to the Jedi High Council. During the blockade of the planet Naboo by the Trade Federation, the Jedi were asked by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum to send Jedi to resolve the blockade. Master Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent to negotiate, but the Trade Federation attempted to kill them. After escaping Naboo with Queen Padmé Amidala and reaching Coruscant, Jinn came before the Jedi Council and described a lightsaber duel he had on Tatooine with a Zabrak, whom Jinn believed to be a Sith. Jinn also presented Anakin Skywalker, a young slave he had freed on Tatooine, before the Jedi Council, stating that he believed him to be the Chosen One. The boy had a high midi-chlorian count and a good grasp on the Force, but Koon, along with the rest of Council, was skeptical about the return of the Sith and denied Jinn's wishes to train Skywalker as a Jedi, due to his age. Eventually Kenobi took the job of training young Anakin after the brutal death of his master.</p>
                        <p>Following the death of Jinn at the hands of the warrior Darth Maul, during the liberation of Naboo from the Trade Federation, Koon traveled to the world along with most of the other Jedi Council members, for Jinn's funeral. The Jedi Council then decided to elevate Obi-Wan Kenobi to the rank of Jedi Knight and allowed him to take Skywalker as his Padawan in order to honor the dying wish of Master Jinn.</p>
                        <h4>Legacy</h4>
                        <p>Shortly after the Battle of Fortress Vader, Vader entered a portal constructed by Darth Momin to resurrect his wife Padmé Amidala. While walking through visions, he encountered Koon along with many Jedi with their lightsabers ready to battle him. However, Vader killed all the illusions, impaling Koon through the chest along with Shaak Ti as the words "Let the past die" resounded in his mind.</p>
                        <h3>Personality and traits</h3>
                        <p>Considered level-headed and unflappably calm, Koon was among the wisest members of the Jedi Order. He was deeply concerned with every form of life. Koon also had shared a special bond with Ahsoka Tano, whom he brought to the Jedi Order as a toddler and continued to be an important mentor too throughout her time as a Jedi.</p>
                        <p>When Tano was framed for murder and treason, Koon found it difficult to believe that the girl he'd brought into the Jedi Order could have fallen into darkness, but the evidence against Tano seemed overwhelming and he joined the Council in expelling her from the Order. After her innocence was proven and the real traitor apprehended, Koon joined his colleagues in apologizing to Tano and inviting her to rejoin the Order. He was deeply saddened when Tano instead chose to walk away from the only life she'd ever known.</p>
                        <p>Plo Koon was one of the best pilots in the Jedi Order and his skills were often praised by fellow Jedi such as Anakin Skywalker when he and Obi-Wan Kenobi crashed on Carnelion IV and Mace Windu when he assembled his team for one of his first missions in the Clone Wars and compared the pilot skills of Rissa Mano with Plo Koon.</p>
