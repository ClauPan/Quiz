                        <h2>Sith Empire</h2>
                        <img src="../images/highsith.png" alt="">
                        <p>The Galactic Empire can be said to have begun with the scheming aspiration of Senator Palpatine of Naboo, whose alter ego was the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Using the Trade Federation as a pawn to blockade Naboo in 32 BBY, he used manipulation of the crisis, as well as of Queen Padm√© Amidala, to instigate a Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, and ultimately to become Chancellor himself. When his apprentice, Darth Maul, was defeated by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi on Naboo, Sidious took on the former Jedi Count Dooku as his new apprentice. Count Dooku then joined with the Trade Federation under Viceroy Nute Gunray and others to form the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This group, known as the Separatists, ignited a war with the Galactic Republic known as the Clone Wars. It was named after the clone troopers used by the Republic.</p>
                        <p>Manipulating the war from behind the scenes, Palpatine arranged for extraordinary powers to be granted to the office of Supreme Chancellor, and for the deaths of many Jedi throughout the war. However, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker discovered that Palpatine was a Sith Lord and, after informing Jedi Master Mace Windu of his discovery, a Jedi task force, led by Windu himself, attempted to arrest him. After a brief duel, Palpatine appeared to be defeated. Skywalker arrived and demanded Windu not kill the Sith Lord. Deeply troubled, Skywalker nonetheless helped Palpatine kill Windu, and thus became the Emperor's new apprentice, Darth Vader. Palpatine then proceeded to carry out the Great Jedi Purge, which eliminated almost all of the thousands of Jedi, and had Vader eliminate Nute Gunray and the other Separatist leaders on the fiery world of Mustafar, thus bringing an end to the Clone Wars. Secure in his power and position, Palpatine used the so-called Jedi rebellion to issue the Declaration of a New Order and declared himself Emperor in 19 BBY.</p>
                        <p>The Galactic Empire flourished under Palpatine's rule until the Alliance to Restore the Republic, also known as the Rebel Alliance, became a serious threat following the Corellian Treaty and the issuance of the Declaration of Rebellion in 2 BBY. The Rebel Alliance engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Empire, and scored a major victory against the Galactic Empire at the Battle of Yavin, where hero, Jedi apprentice of Kenobi, and son of Vader, Luke Skywalker destroyed the first Death Star. Skywalker continued to fight the Galactic Empire, and continued his training under Jedi Master Yoda. Four years later, the Rebel Alliance destroyed the second Death Star at the Battle of Endor, resulting in the deaths of Palpatine and Vader, the end of the Rule of Two, and the fracturing of the Galactic Empire. The Rebel Alliance reestablished itself as the New Republic.</p>
