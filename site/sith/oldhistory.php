                        <h2>Sith Empire</h2>
                        <img src="../images/oldsith.png" alt="">
                        <p>The Sith Empire, later known as the Old Sith Empire or Original Sith Empire, was a rich and powerful empire in the Outer Rim established by Dark Jedi who were banished from the Galactic Republic after their defeat at the Battle of Corbos during the Hundred-Year Darkness.</p>
                        <p>The Jedi exiles fled to the remote world of Korriban, where, after conquering it, they interbred with the native Sith species through the art of Sith alchemy, beginning a long period of building and expansion. The Sith Empire developed in complete isolation within the Stygian Caldera for two thousand years before it eventually rediscovered the Republic.</p>
                        <p>Under the leadership of the Dark Lord Naga Sadow, the Empire invaded Republic space during the Great Hyperspace War, but it was defeated. The Sith Empire was believed to have been destroyed by Republic forces during the second battle of Korriban.</p>
                        <p>However, the Sith Lord Vitiate survived the destruction and led many of the remaining Sith in rebuilding the Empire in the Unknown Regions. Though the Sith Empire was defeated, it served as an example to be followed by numerous Empires of later eras, with a legacy that extended across millennia.</p>
                        <h3>Revan and Malak's Sith Empire</h3>
                        <p>In 3976 BBY the Mandalorian Wars engulfed the galaxy, threatening the destruction of the Galactic Republic. The Jedi High Council abstained from participating in the war, sensing danger, but not all Jedi followed their example. A Jedi known as the Revanchist recruited like-minded members of the order and led the Republic to victory over the Mandalorians, ending the war in 3960 BBY. Some time during or near after the war ended, Revan visited the Trayus Academy on the Sith world of Malachor V. There, he discovered evidence that an ancient Sith faction survived the violence of the Great Hyperspace War and existed in the Unknown Regions. Revan pursued these rumors and came into contact with the Sith Emperor, a surviving Sith Lord who turned him to the dark side. Revan was sent back to the Republic to prepare it for the invasion of the Exiled Sith, but instead Revan and his apprentice, Malak, acted for their own gain. Secretly, the pair searched for ancient Star Maps that led them to the Star Forge, a treasure of the forgotten Rakatan Infinite Empire. Using the Star Forge, Revan raised his own Sith Empire and invaded the Galactic Republic.</p>
                        <p>As the Sith's conquest continued unchecked, worlds began to secede to the Sith invasion fleet voluntarily, either out of fear or because they believed that the corrupt and ineffectual Republic was finally about to fall. However, the Republic armadas were saved from certain destruction by the talents of a young Jedi Padawan named Bastila Shan. During a long string of Republic losses, her skills in battle meditation staved off utter defeat, and when the Sith were on the brink of victory, Bastila led a Jedi strike team to invade Darth Revan's flagship. Ever ambitious, Malak fired upon his master's vessel, hoping to destroy his enemies and usurp control of the Sith Empire with one swift stroke, but all did not go as he had planned. The ship was destroyed, but the Jedi were able to escape with a critically injured Revan. The Jedi Council repaired Revan's broken mind, implanting him with the personality of a loyal soldier of the Republic. As he fought the Sith Empire alongside Bastila, he regained memories of being the Sith Lord Revan, but stayed loyal to the Republic and to the light side of the Force. He led the assault on the Star Forge during the Battle of Rakata Prime and killed his former pupil. The Star Forge plunged into Rakata's sun and was destroyed, effectively destroying the Sith Empire of Revan and Malak as well.</p>
                        <h3>The Sith Triumvirate's Sith Empire</h3>
                        <p>The Sith Triumvirate was a loose alliance of what remained of Darth Revan's Sith. It was solidified sometime after the Battle of Rakata Prime around the Trayus Academy on Malachor V. This organization was made up of several, if not hundreds, of Sith apprentices, Sith Masters, and, most importantly, Sith assassins, and fell under the leadership of three powerful Sith Lords, Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, co-rulers of a new Sith Empire. From Malachor V, they subtly intervened with galactic affairs, using Darth Traya's idea of echoes in the Force, and corrupting Jedi to the dark side. Sion quickly grew impatient of waiting to fight the Jedi and the Republic, while Nihilus grew hungry and needed Force sustenance.</p>
                        <p>The two conspired against Darth Traya and attacked when she was vulnerable. The two Lords used an unknown Force technique to sever her connection to the Force, leaving her cast out by both Jedi and Sith. Abandoning her Sith name and title and traveling as Kreia, the fallen Sith Lord directed her anger towards the Force itself, viewing it as a malevolent intelligent being. She directed her manipulations toward the Jedi Exile, who had cut herself off from the Force following the events of the Mandalorian Wars, and in whom Kreia saw a means to destroy the Force itself. Sion and Nihilus went their separate ways, Sion carrying out a purge of the Jedi Order and Nihilus consuming entire civilizations in his hunger. They then turned on each other, each controlling a nearly equal section of their Sith Empire. Thus began the Sith Civil War.</p>
                        <p>Under Kreia's direction, the Jedi Exile retrained herself as a Jedi and fought the Sith Empire of Sion and Nihilus, eventually destroying them both. Kreia revealed her true intentions, killing the survivors of the Jedi High Council and luring the Jedi Exile to the Trayus Academy on Malachor V. There, Kreia—once again in the guise of Darth Traya, Sith Lord of Betrayal—fought the Exile with the intention of using the retrained Jedi's unique connection to the Force in order to destroy the Force entirely. The Jedi Exile defeated Traya and Malachor V was destroyed by Bao-Dur's Mass Shadow Generator in 3951 BBY, ending her Sith Empire once and for all.</p>
